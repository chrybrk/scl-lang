~ ideas?
    ~ let x: dynamic *; // creates a dynamic array
    ~ let x: arena *;   // creates a buffer to store.
    ~ defer return 0;   // runs at the end.
    ~ asm("mov rdi, rax");
    ~ better error system [done]
    ~ clean-up `src/gen.c` [todo]
    ~ extern support data type
    ~ lazy evaluation | option to turn it off, because other object may refer to the declared function.
        - extern only includes when its called.
        - variable only declare when its been used.
        - function only define if its been used.
        - loops only define if the value are above the condition.
